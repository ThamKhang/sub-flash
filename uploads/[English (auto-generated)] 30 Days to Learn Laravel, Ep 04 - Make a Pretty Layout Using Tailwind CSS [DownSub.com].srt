[Music]

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,319
all right welcome to day four everybody

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,200
Why Don't We Begin by quickly going over

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,480
the homework from day three so you may

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,639
remember I asked you to extract one of

6
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,519
these navigation links into its own

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,080
dedicated component so let's do that now

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,439
together so in my components directory

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:22,199
and actually a quick note uh I made it

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,000
capital here it's kind of muscle memory

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,640
from other Frameworks I also use uh but

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,519
it can absolutely be lowercase if you

13
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,238
prefer all right anyways uh nav link.

14
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:36,239
blade. PHP all right let's grab this and

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,760
paste it in like so switch back and now

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,120
this can become xnav link like so all

17
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,320
right obviously a little more work to do

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,680
but let's have a look in the browser all

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,480
right come back give it a refresh and

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,000
yeah we do see the home link but it's

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,079
not very functional right this needs to

22
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,160
be dynamic so that it can be used for

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,160
any nav link item all right so why don't

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,199
we do that slot technique here let's

25
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,799
come back to layouts and now this can

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:06,960
become

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
home this one can become about and this

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,479
one can become contact all right come

29
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:15,320
back give it a refresh all right that

30
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,080
looks good but now of course you'll

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,240
notice they're all linking to the exact

32
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,240
same place all right so this is where

33
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,400
the homework got a little bit tricky you

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
may not know about this so it sounds

35
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,479
like I need to pass in a an href like we

36
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:31,920
did like we do with a normal link right

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,280
that would make

38
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,079
sense however in the nav link component

39
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,119
how do we access it right uh well as it

40
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,159
turns out all layal blade components

41
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,360
have access to an attributes object and

42
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,439
that object will contain uh all the

43
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,240
details for any attributes you pass and

44
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,640
by attributes I mean hre I mean ID I

45
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,280
mean class any of these okay so if I

46
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,640
come back to our component yeah what we

47
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,200
could do initially is just open up an

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,439
echo um PHP Echo and then say attributes

49
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,119
and that will properly be stringified

50
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,360
now yeah again keep in mind attributes

51
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,800
is an object so there's actually more

52
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,319
bells and whistles than what you

53
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,319
initially see here for example if you

54
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,120
want to merge in some sensible defaults

55
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
you could do so like this but we're

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
getting a little ahead of ourselves so

57
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,640
let's keep it very simple right now all

58
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,239
right back to the browser give it a

59
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,640
refresh and now we should see the about

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,200
page page and the contact page and yeah

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,080
just to be crystal clear here what if I

62
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
wanted to say uh the about page should

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,760
have a style tag where the color is

64
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,159
green or something like that well that

65
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,480
too will be included in that attributes

66
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,239
object so if I come back and give it a

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,360
refresh sure enough it's green okay so

68
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,440
now you're probably thinking okay fine

69
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,280
but why would we ever do this uh and the

70
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,840
answer is well maybe for simple things

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,480
you wouldn't however in real life a

72
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,560
navlink is a little bit more complicated

73
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,920
than a simple anchor tag uh think about

74
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,560
it you will need specific classes or

75
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,879
styling based on whether it is the

76
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,720
currently active page or not um there

77
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,480
might be other situations where the

78
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,640
presentation should differ based upon I

79
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,920
don't know where you are in the website

80
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,040
or what your screen size is anyways the

81
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,239
whole point is it gets a little bit more

82
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:25,480
complicated than a basic anchor tag in

83
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,040
most cases so if we extract all of this

84
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,280
into its own naving component

85
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,799
we can isolate any of that complexity

86
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,519
into a single file which is really cool

87
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,920
all right but yeah that was just an

88
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,319
example I'm going to delete it and now I

89
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,040
want to make things look a little bit

90
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,879
more attractive so here's what I'm going

91
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,200
to do I'm going to switch over to

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,799
tailwind

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,959
css.com and actually on that note before

94
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,640
we begin um if you don't know what tail1

95
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,760
CSS is trust me it's entirely fine you

96
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,720
don't need to it's not a prerequisite

97
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,840
for the course it's just a way to

98
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
quickly and rapidly build up um some

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,959
layouts and such without having to refer

100
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,400
to a CSS file so Tailwind is a CSS
